            Passepartout was delighted. His master's last exploit, the
            consequences of which he ignored, enchanted him. Never had the crew
            seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow. He formed warm friendships
            with the sailors, and amazed them with his acrobatic feats. He
            thought they managed the vessel like gentlemen, and that the stokers
            fired up like heroes. His loquacious good-humour infected everyone.
          </p>

          <p>
            He had forgotten the past,
            <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank"
              >its vexations and delays</a
            >. He only thought of the end, so nearly accomplished; and sometimes
            he boiled over with impatience, as if heated by the furnaces of the
            Henrietta. Often, also, the worthy fellow revolved around Fix,
            looking at him with a keen, distrustful eye; but he did not speak to
            him, for their old intimacy no longer existed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fix, it must be confessed, understood nothing of what was going on.
            The conquest of the Henrietta, the bribery of the crew, Fogg
            managing the boat like a skilled seaman, amazed and confused him. He
            did not know what to think.

            As for Captain Speedy, he continued to howl and growl in his cabin;
            and Passepartout, whose duty it was to carry him his meals,
            courageous as he was, took the greatest precautions. Mr. Fogg did
            not seem even to know that there was a captain on board.
